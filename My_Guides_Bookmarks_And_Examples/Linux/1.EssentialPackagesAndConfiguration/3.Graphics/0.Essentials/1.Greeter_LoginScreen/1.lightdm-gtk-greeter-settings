1. "sudo pacman -S lightdm-settings"
2. Run it:  "Login Window".
3.  The "Special" thing here is  that Backgrounds and Icons have to be in System "/",not in "home".
4. XFCE4 default's background location is "/usr/share/backgrounds/xfce".
5. So we make "sudo mkdir /usr/share/backgrounds/mine".
6. Then we lock downloads directory "/home/my_username/Downloads/" and list "ls".
7. "sudo mv <my downloaded pic>.png /usr/share/backgrounds/mine/<my downloaded pic>.png"
